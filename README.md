⭐️ Starbox Python package and notebooks for exploring radio astronomy concepts and tools.

🛠️ Warning: this is a work in progress and subject to frequent changes!

See [full documentation](https://open-research.gemmadanks.com/radio-astronomy-playground/) for details.

## 🚀 Features

- 👾 Simulate an observation:
    - 📡 Array of stations
    - ✨ Sky model
    - 💨 Corruptions
- 💡 Interactively tune data processing parameters:
    - 🧹 Single self-calibration loop

### 📦 Installation

1. [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
1. Clone and install the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gemmadanks/radio-astronomy-playground
cd radio-astronomy-playground
uv sync --all-groups
```

### 🏁 Quickstart

Launch the get-started notebook to run your first interactive experiment:
```bash
uv run marimo run notebooks/get-started.py
```

### Developer guide

A [Dockerfile](./devcontainer/Dockerfile) and [configuration](./devcontainer/devcontainer.json) in [./devcontainer](./devcontainer) can be used in VSCode or GitHub Codespaces to work in a pre-configured development environment. It uses a Python 3.13 base image and installs uv, just and all Python dependencies.

To open the project in the container VSCode, you will need to add the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) and download [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) (or [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation) -- and [configure VSCode to use podman instead of Docker](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/docker-options#_podman)). Open the VSCode command palette (Cmd+Shift+P) and select:
``` bash
Dev Containers: Reopen in Container
```
See the [VSCode tutorial on devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial) for more details on using devcontainers.

#### 🧪 Common Tasks

Several common tasks have been added as recipes to a [justfile](justfile) in the root of the repository:

```bash
just install               # uv sync
just test                  # run quick (non-slow) tests
just test-notebooks        # run notebook tests
just lint                  # ruff check
just format                # ruff format
just type-check            # pyright type-check
just docs-serve            # live docs
just docs-build            # build docs
just pre-commit            # run all pre-commit hooks
just clean                 # remove generated files and folders
just jupyter-container     # start Jupyter lab from inside a container
```

To launch an interactive notebook in a web browser in edit mode run:
```bash
uv run marimo edit notebooks/get-started.py
```

See [marimo documentation](https://docs.marimo.io/) for more details on how to create and run the notebooks.
