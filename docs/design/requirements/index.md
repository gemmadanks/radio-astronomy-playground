# Requirements

Functional requirements (what the software will do) for Radio Astronomy Playground are formulated as user stories and BDD scenarios. Non-functional requirements (how the software should do it) are formulated as quality scenarios and organised into a utility tree. These will evolve over time.

See [impact map](../vision/impact-map.md) for how the delivery slices below relate to impacts and goals.

## Slice S1: Self-calibration loop + diagnostics (MVP)
