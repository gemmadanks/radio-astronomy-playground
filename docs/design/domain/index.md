# Domain

Radio Astronomy Playground uses ideas from domain-driven design (DDD) to guide development and documentation. These include:

## 📡 [Ubiquitous language](concepts/index.md)
Building a **ubiquitous language** of radio astronomy terms that is reflected in the code, which makes it easier to communicate with domain experts and to learn radio astronomy through code-based experiments.

## 🧩 [Domain model](aggregates.md)
Designing the software around a **domain model** with context boundaries defined according to how radio astronomers typically process data from an observation.

## ⏰ [Event storming](event-storming/index.md)
Using an **event-storming**-inspired approach to explore and document radio astronomy workflows and interactive experiments.
